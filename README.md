# Unicorn Project

ðŸ¦„ Project Background

The online sector has been slowly eating up market share in the past two decades. E-commerce platforms like Unicorn allow people to buy products online: from books, toys, clothes, and shoes to food, furniture, and other household items. The following dataset includes Unicorn sales data from the years 2015-2018.
The Unicorn is a family business and is owned by 2 stakeholders who are very invested in their business. My task is to analyze the data, find interesting insights, and identify weak areas and opportunities for Unicorn to boost its business growth

ðŸ§¹Project Logistics

The project is divided into 4 parts:
Explore a Unicorn data sample organized into a database with four tables. Answer predefined questions employing SQL.
Explore a unified dataset (.csv file) in Spreadsheets to analyze and visualize the data while finding interesting insights.
Use Tableau to perform exploratory data analysis and pull unique insights from the dataset. Create a dashboard that will dynamically present the findings.
Make a one-page report with main insights and recommendations.
